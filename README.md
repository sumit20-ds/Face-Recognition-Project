# Face-Recognition-Project
A real-time face detection system using Python and OpenCV. It captures video from a webcam, converts frames to grayscale, and detects faces using a Haar Cascade Classifier. Detected faces are highlighted with rectangles, demonstrating computer vision’s use in automation, security, and recognition.
